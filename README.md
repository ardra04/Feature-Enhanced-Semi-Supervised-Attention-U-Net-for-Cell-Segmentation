# Feature-Enhanced-Semi-Supervised-Attention-U-Net-for-Cell-Segmentation

Blood test is one of the primary measures utilized for detecting and monitoring of various health conditions. It has the range of each cells needed for a healthy person to the actual percentage of cells in the body.
To get the correct proportion of each cells, they need to be properly segment out from the background. The process of segmenting cells from the background is cell segmentation.

Cell segmentation aids in :
Proper Identification of diseases
Measuring disease severity

Cell Segmentation Appraoches : 
Manual counting of cells are Time Consuming and prone to human errors
Traditional approaches including water-shed segmentation and thresholding are sensitive to image variation and struggles in handling complex cells
Deep learning approaches like U-Net is specially designed for bio-medical image segmentation. It’s symmetric structure allows efficient segmentation with varying size and shape.

Dataset :
Most of the researches involve cells that are stained, but these affect the true nature of the cell, thereby alter the results.
Livecell datasets are limited and most of the existing datasets only have fewer images.
LIVECell – A large-scale dataset for label-free live cell segmentation, with 5239 manually annotated images, with more than 1.6 million individual cells.


Problem of labelling dataset:
Manually annotating cell images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Each cell must be carefully outlined, often requiring expert knowledge to distinguish between touching or overlapping cells.
